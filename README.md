Florida Biodiversity Cluster Map
Overview
This interactive map visualizes biodiversity clusters in Florida using iNaturalist research-grade data from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). The map allows users to explore biodiversity hotspots and their properties based on zip codes.

## Overview
This interactive map visualizes biodiversity clusters in Florida using iNaturalist research-grade data from GBIF.

## Features
- Interactive map of Florida showing biodiversity clusters
- Cluster analysis based on DBSCAN algorithm (10 points within 1 km)
- Cluster property identification including user diversity and main species
- Zip code-based cluster lookup
- Aerial map view option
- Display of top species in each cluster

## Methodology
1. Data acquisition: Downloaded Florida iNaturalist research-grade data from GBIF
2. Cluster analysis: Implemented DBSCAN algorithm to identify clusters (10 points within 1 km)
3. Cluster property analysis: Determined user diversity and main species for each cluster
4. Map creation: Utilized geopy and Leaflet to generate an interactive map
5. Functionality implementation: Developed features for zip code-based searches, aerial view toggling, and top species display

## How to Use
1. Enter a zip code to view biodiversity clusters in that area
2. Click on clusters to view detailed properties
3. Toggle between standard and aerial map views
4. Explore top species in each cluster
